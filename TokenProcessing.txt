	operator vs. string vs. number
	
2. token sub-category i.e.
	logical operator vs additive operator or real number vs integer

3. token level
4. processing order
5. token value

		category / sub-category
	needs to identify its unit type



Token Value
1. needs the value
	as a string
	native format (as a number if a number)
